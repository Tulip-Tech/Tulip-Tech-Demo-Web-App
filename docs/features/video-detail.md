# Video detail

A video detail page is where a viewer evaluates a published video, before deciding to play the video.

![Video detail](./../_images/video-detail.jpg)

This page displays attributes that are common to all videos, such as:

- Title
- Year
- Length
- Genre
- Rating
- Description
- Image

## Image

- The poster image is available in different resolutions

- Some platforms require alternate poster images. That needs to be solved with custom properties and a CMS that handles the images.

## Trailers

Customers can add movie trailers to a video through the a custom field `trailerId`. The trailer is just another media item to play. See example below.
