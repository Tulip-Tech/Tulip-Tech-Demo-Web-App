# Video Analytics

By understanding how viewers consume content across OTT Apps, customers can create informed monetization and engagement strategies.

Video analytics also allows JW Player to calculate recommendations and trending videos, which are critical in monetizing videos.

## Video Event Endpoint

Updating JW Player on OTT video events happens by calling the following endpoint:

```
https://ihe.jwpltx.com/v1/jwplayer6/ping.gif?e=<eventid>&<event-metrics-as-params->
```

For advertisement events (ad impressions) the following endpoint needs to be called:

```
https://ihe.jwpltx.com/v1/clienta/ping.gif?e=<eventid>&<event-metrics-as-params->
```

## Reporting

The data is available to customers in three ways:

- [Dashboard](https://support.jwplayer.com/articles/jw-player-analytics-reference)
- [Reporting API](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/analytics-getting-started)
- Play Sessions Data Export which provides aggregated play session data and more detailed metrics in s3 buckets

## Events

The app sends the following events (param `e`) to JW platform:

| Name       | Value | Endpoint  | Rqd | Description                                                          |
| ---------- | ----- | --------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Setup      | e     | jwplayer6 | Yes | Fired after the landing screen embedding this video has been loaded. |
| Impression | i     | clienta   | Yes | Fired after the first frame of an ad creative has been rendered.     |
| Play       | s     | jwplayer6 | Yes | Fired after the first frame of a video has been rendered.            |
| Quantile   | t     | jwplayer6 | Yes | Fired after the video plays past the threshold of a quantile.        |

## Event JS Script

The event trigger implementation for the ott web app can be found at [jwpltx.js](/public/jwpltx.js)

Note that `navigator.sendBeacon()` is used to call the endpoints. The browser will not do CORS checks on this operation. It furthermore minimizes performance impact as the browser doesn't wait for the response of the server.

## Analytics ID

A special data parameter is the Analytics ID (`aid`). It determines to which JW Player account & property the events belong. Each property has its unique analytics ID and is provided by a JW PLayer Solution Engineer or Account manager.

For the OTT Web App the Analytics ID is stored in [`config.json`](/public/config.json) as `analyticsToken`

## Metrics

Each event comes with a set of data sent through the query parameters of the JWPlayer OTT Analytics endpoints:

- Session - Timestamp and unique keys
- App - The app of the viewer
- Device - The device of the viewer
- Media - The media that is being watched
- Quantile - How much the user watched a particular movie

Theee metrics are described below.

<sup>1</sup>Only requied for the play event `s`

### Quantile Metrics

Quantiles are to track how much of a video is watched. It's fired after the video plays past the threshold of a quantile. The number of quantiles in a video depends on video length.

There are 3 related parameters:

- Video Duration `vd`
- Video Quantiles `q`
- Quantile Watched `pw`

The table belows defines the relations and when the Quantile (`t`) event ping should be fired.

Any decimal values are truncated to an integer.

#### Example

- a video is 72 seconds long (`vd=72`)
- hence it will be split into 8 quantiles (`q=8`). Each quantile will be 72/8=9 seconds.
- the first quantile event should fire when the 9th second of the video has been crossed. Quantile watched would have value 16 (`pw=16`).
- the second time this event should fire when the 18th second is crossed. Quantile watched its value would be 32 (`pw=32`)

### Live Streams

For live streams, this quantile distribution is ignored and time ticks are sent at pre-set intervals. We recommend 20 seconds. The following values are sent:

- pw (Quantile watched): -1
- q (Quantiles): 0
- ti (Interval in seconds): 20
