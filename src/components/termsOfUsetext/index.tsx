      third-party software.
      <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
      PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither you nor Game in Frame will seek to have a
      dispute heard as a class action or private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a
      representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitrations or
      proceedings. You and Game in Frame agree to arbitrate, as provided below, all disputes that are not resolved informally, except disputes relating to the
      ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights. “Dispute” includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or
      future events, between you and us concerning Game in Frame or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or
      equitable basis. You and Game in Frame empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
      applicability or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any
      part of this Agreement are void or voidable. A. In the event of a dispute, you or Game in Frame must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is
      a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and
      the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute to Game in Frame, 37-14 32nd St, Apt 202, Long Island City, NY 11101. We will send any notice of
      dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and Game in Frame will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within
      sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, you or we may commence an arbitration
      proceeding. You may instead litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or
      not you negotiated informally first. B. If you and Game in Frame do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute
      shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S.
      Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Arbitration will be administered by JAMS
      Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services (“JAMS”) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”). The JAMS
      Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. Arbitration may be conducted in person,
      through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. Proceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online,
      will take place in New York, New York. You and Game in Frame agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Kings
      County, New York, New York in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on
      the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief,
      but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or
      Game in Frame) is responsible for paying the filing fee. Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in New York, New York, nothing in this
      arbitration provision shall be construed as consent by Game in Frame to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes, claims or
      controversies unrelated to Game in Frame or this Agreement. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement
      that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in Kings County, New York,
      New York, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action. This
      Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to
      any conflict of law principles.
      <h3>Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>
      Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
      these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to
      the &quot;parties&quot;; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.{' '}
